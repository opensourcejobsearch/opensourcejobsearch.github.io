- Greenfield Projects

- Attractive performance based remuneration

A Sydney based start up that's been operating for the almost three years and is a leading Australian organisation in their field is looking to add to its expanding team.

You will be working with a product which will impact indirectly or directly every Australian so there is large scope and opportunities ahead.

There is a small, collaborative team already in place at the brand new CBD offices.

The environment is casual yet everyone there is passionate about their work and is a keen technologist.

Play a key role within flexible structures, flat hierarchies and with motivated colleagues.

We welcome OO programmers who are just learning Node.js still. </p>
